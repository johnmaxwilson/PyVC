PyVC
====

PyVC is a set of python tools designed to analyze Virtual California
simulations. The 'modernizing' branch contains a full rewrite of the 'master'
branch with a focus on speed, elegance and portability. The functionality of the
'master' branch is being migrated tool by tool so the tools will become
available as they are completed.

To see what the new PyVC can do, run python pyvc_tests.py from the command line.
